# SnippetSharp
A small utility to keep the code snippets around. 

Sometimes I need really basic code snippets and I try to remember the solution and the project that I used them in. 
This utility is a small program that keeps my codes in an XML database. 

Now it has search support for categories and snippet descriptions.
