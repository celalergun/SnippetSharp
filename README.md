# SnippetSharp
A small utility to keep the code snippets around. 

Sometimes I need really basic code snippets and I try to remember the solution and the project that I used them in. 
This utility is a small program that keeps my codes in an XML database. 

Now it has search support for categories and snippet descriptions.

A context menu has been added to the snippet rich edit to clear and paste from the clipboard. Pasting the text via context menu deletes the beginning space chars while keeping the indentation intact.
